# JON-19 — Prompt template for correction classification

This folder contains the prompt template, JSON schema, and worked examples for classifying support bot corrections and extracting structured fields.

Artifacts:

- `prompt.md` — the full prompt template with clear instructions and embedded few‑shot examples
- `schema.json` — JSON Schema for the structured output
- `samples/` — 5 sample inputs and their expected structured outputs, plus brief consistency notes

These assets are documentation-only and do not require runtime integration with the API client from JON-18.
